#Find and fix unidentified emails
A combination of the scripts Find Unidentified Emails and Fix Unidentified Emails.
First "Find" is run and the found emails are tagged.
Then the tagged emails together with all RFC822 items are processed by "Fix".

If no items are selected a default search is run in "Find" and the found items are processed.

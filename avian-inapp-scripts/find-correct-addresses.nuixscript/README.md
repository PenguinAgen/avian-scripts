# Find correct addresses
Identifies which addresses, names, and other identifiers refer to the same 'person', and writes this information to a file named 'find\_correct\_addresses\_output.txt' in the specified location.
This script is not useful in itself, but its output is used by other scripts.

# Notes
Addresses in communications usually appear in pairs with a 'personal' part and an 'address' part.
This is used to create a union-find data structure.

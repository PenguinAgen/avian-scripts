# Tag Exchange Emails with Duplicates
Tags all emails starting with a specified text string as being exchange server emails.
Then gives all these emails a custom metadata field saying whether there is another email with the same ID among the non-exchange server emails.

The tags and custom metadata fields are customizable through the GUI.

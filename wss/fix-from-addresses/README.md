# Fix from addresses
Uses the output of the in-app script 'Find correct addresses' to replace as many mangled addresses like those generated by microsoft exchange server as possible with the matching human readable addresses.

## Usage
To use this script the data must already be loaded in to Nuix.
First, run the in-app script 'Find correct addresses' on the case, settings the output directory to the `data` directory in the Avian scripts directory.
Then reload all items on which you would like to run this script.
See the main readme for instruction on how to run this script.

If the reloaded items have a communication with a From address, but don't have a custom metadata field named 'CorrectFromAddress', the script did not run properly.
Check the log.
